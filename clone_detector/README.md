* Requirements  
    * Install Scala on your machine, suggested IDE is intellij, you can install the scala plugin to support scala language.
    * Install Scalameta library. The latest version is 3.7.3, but within the bank, they are using 2.12-1.7.0. Not sure whether you can still find 2.12, so some parser code is commented out for consistency.
    * install sbt 1.5
